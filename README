yolopatch -- when ksplice is too much hard work

this is code for a loadable kernel module that when inserted, patches a byte
in your kernel's address space. 

if you don't know exactly what this code does, running it may cause weird
shit to happen. I don't know what exactly can happen when you try to "patch"
code that is being run but i don't think it's the best idea. also make sure
you have the right address.
